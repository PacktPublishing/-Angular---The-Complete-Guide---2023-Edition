Optional: TypeScript Quick Introduction
At the end of this course, you also find a "TypeScript Introduction" section which is 100% optional. You can jump to this section now or take a look at it at a later point of time, in case you want to get a quick TypeScript summary.

I will also introduce and explain key TypeScript concepts as we start using them throughout this course though, hence this section is really just meant to be a "backup section".
